# System Architecture Presentation Script

## Introduction (15 seconds)
"Let me walk you through our multi-agent system architecture that powers our crypto investment platform. We've designed a modular, resilient system capable of adapting to rapidly changing market conditions through specialized, collaborative agents."

## User Input & Main Agent (25 seconds)
[POINT to user input section]
"Everything starts with user inputs - investment amount, blockchain selection, investor type, and risk strategy. These parameters flow into our Main Agent, p8017, which acts as the central orchestrator of the entire system."

[HIGHLIGHT communication pathways]
"All information flows through the Main Agent, providing a single source of truth and preventing conflicting actions between agents."

## Monitoring & Data Collection Agents (30 seconds)

[SWEEP hand across data collection agents]
"Our platform aggregates real-time data from multiple sources: Coin Info Agent fetches cryptocurrency prices, Crypto News Agent gathers market news, and the FGI Agent monitors market sentiment through the Fear & Greed Index."

## AI Decision Making (25 seconds)
[POINT to LLM Agent (ASI1, p8007)]
"At the core of our decision-making is the LLM Agent, which uses advanced AI to determine optimal investment strategies. This agent, ASI1, employs iterate prompting techniques to refine analysis and recommendations."

[HIGHLIGHT ASI1_API]
"Our custom large language model API optimizes financial decision-making, processing diverse inputs to generate tailored investment strategies."

## Execution & Financial Operations (25 seconds)
[POINT to AGENTVERSE_API]
"Once a strategy is formulated, we search for the best execution agents via the AGENTVERSE_API, ensuring optimal transaction routing across different blockchains."

[POINT to Base Agents]
"Our Base blockchain agents - WETH/USDC (p5012) and USDC/WETH (p5013) - execute token swaps through the UNISWAPV2 smart contract."

[POINT to Reward Agent (p8003)]
"The Reward Agent handles staking and rewards, with functions to manage fee payments and reward retrieval."

## Future Expansion & Security (20 seconds)
[POINT to unimplemented components]
"We've designed the system for future expansion, with planned additions like email notifications and a TOKEN smart contract to enhance functionality."

[POINT to Heartbeat Agent (p8011)]
"The Heartbeat Agent continuously monitors user's health, to generates a warning if it detects that there's a possiblility of user acting out of adrenaline rush."

[HIGHLIGHT security measures]
"Security is paramount: agent communications are encrypted, private keys are protected, and continuous monitoring prevents unauthorized activities."

## Closing (15 seconds)
"Our architecture enables fully autonomous, AI-driven investment execution while maintaining transparency and user control. By leveraging specialized agents and advanced AI, we're democratizing sophisticated investment capabilities."
