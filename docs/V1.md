# CryptoFund: Crypto Trading Assistant

## Project Overview

CryptoFund is a decentralized autonomous crypto trading assistant built using FetchAI's agent framework and uAgents. The system leverages multiple specialized AI agents that collaborate to analyze market conditions, sentiment indicators, and financial data to make informed cryptocurrency trading decisions.

## Project Architecture

The system is composed of multiple specialized agents that communicate with each other and external APIs:

1. **Main Agent**: Central coordinator that interacts with all other agents
2. **CoinInfo Agent**: Retrieves cryptocurrency market data 
3. **CryptoNews Agent**: Fetches latest cryptocurrency news
4. **FGI (Fear & Greed Index) Agent**: Monitors market sentiment
5. **Reason Agent (ASI1)**: Analyzes data and makes trading recommendations
6. **SwapFinder Agent**: Discovers and executes token swaps via DEXes
7. **Dashboard Agent**: Provides visualization and monitoring
8. **Topup Agent**: Manages wallet funding
9. **Reward Agent**: Handles payment processing and rewards distribution

## Current Implementation Status

### Core Components

#### Main Agent (`main.py`)
- Central node that coordinates all agent interactions
- Receives user input about blockchain preferences and risk tolerance
- Orchestrates data collection from various sources
- Prepares data for the reasoning layer
- Handles agent startup and regular interval checks
- Passes trading decisions to swap execution

#### CoinInfo Agent (`coininfo_agent.py`)
- Retrieves cryptocurrency market data from external APIs
- Provides current prices, market cap, volume, and 24-hour price changes
- Supports multiple blockchains (Ethereum, Base, Polygon, Bitcoin)

#### FGI Agent (`fgi_agent.py`)
- Connects to CoinMarketCap API to fetch Fear & Greed Index data
- Provides market sentiment analysis
- Includes classification of sentiment (e.g., "Extreme Fear", "Neutral", "Greed")

#### CryptoNews Agent (`cryptonews_agent.py`)
- Fetches latest news related to cryptocurrencies
- Provides context for market analysis

#### Reason Agent (`asi1_test.py`)
- Uses ASI1 AI model to analyze collected data
- Generates trading recommendations based on market data, news, and sentiment
- Considers user's investment style and risk tolerance

#### SwapFinder Agent (`swapland/swapfinder_agent.py`)
- Discovers appropriate swap agents through Agentverse search
- Uses LLM to determine the most suitable agent for token swaps
- Coordinates with DEX integration for executing trades

#### DEX Integration
- Implementation for Uniswap V3 on various networks:
  - Base network (`uni_base_ethusdc.py`, `uni_base_usdceth.py`)
  - Support for ETH/USDC pairs

#### Financial Transaction Agents
- **Topup Agent**: Manages wallet funding
- **Reward Agent**: Handles payment processing and rewards for services

### Additional Features

#### Dashboard Agent (`dashboard_agent.py`)
- Provides visualization of crypto market data
- Displays trading history and performance metrics

## Technical Implementation

### Technologies Used
- **FetchAI's uAgents Framework**: For agent-based architecture
- **ASI1 Mini LLM**: For decision-making and reasoning
- **Flask**: For web-based endpoints and communication
- **UniswapV3**: For performing token swaps on Ethereum and Base networks
- **CoinMarketCap API**: For market data and sentiment metrics
- **Agentverse**: For agent discovery and registration

### Agent Communication
Agents communicate using a message-based protocol with defined data models. Each agent has a unique address and can send/receive messages with specific payloads:

```python
# Example message models
class CoinRequest(Model):
    blockchain: str

class CoinResponse(Model):
    name: str
    symbol: str
    current_price: float
    market_cap: float
    total_volume: float
    price_change_24h: float
```

### Decision Making
The system uses a multi-layer approach to decision making:
1. Data collection from multiple sources (market data, news, sentiment index)
2. Data preparation and normalization by the main agent
3. Analysis by the ASI1 reasoning model considering:
   - Fear & Greed Index sentiment
   - Current market conditions
   - Recent news events
   - User's investment style and risk tolerance
4. Decision execution through appropriate swap agents

## Testing System
The project includes a testing system (`maintest.py`) that:
- Enables wallet top-ups
- Tests agent communication 
- Verifies transaction processing
- Tests swap agent discovery and execution

## Next Steps and Future Development
