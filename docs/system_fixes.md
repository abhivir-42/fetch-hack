# CryptoReason System Fixes

This document outlines the changes made to fix the CryptoReason agent system and ensure proper communication between all agents.

## 1. Port Configuration Issues

### Problem
The main agent was attempting to connect to other agents on incorrect ports. For example:
- Expected heartbeat agent on port 5911, but it was actually on port 5011
- Connection errors to topup agent even though it was running

### Solution
- Updated the API wrapper to use the correct port configurations for all agents:
  - Main Agent: port 8017
  - Heartbeat Agent: port 5011
  - Coin Info Agent: port 8004
  - FGI Agent: port 8006
  - Crypto News Agent: port 8005
  - LLM Agent: port 8007
  - Reward Agent: port 8003
  - Topup Agent: port 8002
  - Swapfinder Agent: port 5008
  - ETH to USDC Swap Agent: port 5012
  - USDC to ETH Swap Agent: estimated port 5013

## 2. Agent Startup Sequence

### Problem
Agents were not being started in the optimal order, causing communication failures when agents tried to communicate with other agents that weren't yet initialized.

### Solution
- Created an improved start_all_agents.py script that:
  - Starts agents in a logical sequence (dependencies first)
  - Adds sufficient delay between agent startups (7 seconds)
  - Checks for already running agents to avoid port conflicts
  - Verifies successful agent startup before proceeding
  - Logs all agent output to separate files for troubleshooting

## 3. API Wrapper Enhancements

### Problem
The original API wrapper had hardcoded configurations and didn't properly handle connection issues.

### Solution
- Refactored the API wrapper to:
  - Store all agent configurations in a centralized data structure
  - Dynamically check for agent status based on port activity
  - Provide more robust error handling for API endpoints
  - Include appropriate timeout and retry logic
  - Return helpful status information and error messages

## 4. Documentation Updates

### Additional Documentation
- Updated port numbers and agent addresses in all documentation
- Added troubleshooting information for common issues
- Provided clear instructions for proper agent startup
- Created an Agent Inspector URL reference
- Added explanations of expected agent output for validation

## Verification Process

After making these changes, the system was tested by:

1. Running the `start_all_agents.py` script
2. Monitoring each agent's startup output
3. Confirming successful agent registration
4. Verifying inter-agent communication
5. Starting the API wrapper and testing its endpoints

## Next Steps

1. **Investigate Main Agent Configuration**: Update any hardcoded agent addresses in main.py if needed
2. **Add Healthcheck Endpoint**: Create a simple healthcheck for all agents
3. **Improve Error Recovery**: Implement automatic restart of failed agents
4. **Connection Pooling**: Add connection pooling to improve reliability
5. **Set Up Monitoring**: Implement a monitoring dashboard for the agent network
