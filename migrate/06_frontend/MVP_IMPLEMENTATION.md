   - Protected routes for authenticated users
   - Authentication context for global state management

3. **Wallet Integration**
   - Wallet connection component
   - Private key input with secure handling
   - Network selection
   - Connection status display

4. **Dashboard**

- Authentication API
- Wallet API
- Market API
- Agents API

   - Theme switching works
   - Forms validate input properly
   - Mock API data displays correctly

## Next Steps

1. **API Integration**
   - Connect to real backend APIs
   - Implement proper error handling

2. **Enhanced Visualizations**
   - Add interactive charts for crypto prices
   - Implement real-time updates
